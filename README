Trumpy Bird is a parody of the notorious Flappy Bird game developed with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The objective of the game is to avoid obstacles by jumping through the openings.

The project was designed and built within a one-week timeframe.

## Features

### Board Creating and Binging

Boards are a way for users to make collections of their favorite binges. Boards can categorized for easy organization and search. A single modal component can be used for all binge/board-related tasks:

```js
function Modal({modal, closeModal}) {
  if (!modal) {
    return null;
  }
  let component;
  switch (modal) {
    case 'createBoard':
      component = <BoardFormContainer cancel={closeModal}/>;
      break;
    case 'editBoard':
      component = <BoardUpdateContainer cancel={closeModal}/>;
      break;
    case 'createBinge':
      component = <BingeFormContainer cancel={closeModal}/>;
      break;
    case 'editBinge':
      component = <BingeUpdateContainer cancel={closeModal}/>;
      break;
    case 'createBinging':
      component = <BingingFormContainer cancel={closeModal}/>;
      break;
    default:
      return null;
  }
  return (
    <div className="modal-background" onClick={closeModal}>
      <div className="modal-child" onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}>
        { component }
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Adaptive Feed

The discover feed dynamically adapts to display all binges in an aesthetic manner through a masonry layout. The number of columns are calculated based on screen size and can accommodate a variety of devices.
